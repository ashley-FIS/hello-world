Hey there!

My name is Ashley. 
I currently work in marketing in the tech-ed space, and data analytics has become a big part of the work I do. My background is in higher education, liberal arts, and philosphy. I'm new to the tech industry, and I have seen an extensive amount of concerning indications that big data is being used unethically to promote profits and privilage without considering the human cost.
This has led to a personal passion to have a greater understanding of data sourcing and data usage, primarily from the ethics perspective of these domains. 
I decided to complete Flatirons's dsbc on my path to becoming a Data Ethicist.
